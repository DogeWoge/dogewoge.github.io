That noon, I saw you from the corner

As you entered the room, your friends waved to you cheerfully

With them, you laughed and laughed.

You don’t notice me as I quietly leave the room, jealous.

That afternoon, I watched from the kitchen

As you count the awards set on the bookshelves with our parents  

You don’t notice me as I slip my report card into the pile of comic books 

was to throw away to make way for your twenty-seventh trophy

That evening, I hid my tear-striken face under the sheets  

As you gently place next to me a gift-wrapped box

You don’t know how to comfort me, so you had gotten me a present instead. 

But as I tried to untie the ribbon, you tell me to wait 

To wait for a time when I feel that everything is lost.

The box would make me happy, you said.

That morning, I found on the table a crumpled note

I stared at your perfect handwriting in horror

I rode my bike to the forest we had played in

before the harshness of the world was forced upon us

Mom and dad do not notice me as I rode past the police car 

But I heard their cries.

The lights of the ambulance flashed red and blue 

I knew that It was too late.

That night, I dug out the box covered in red and white wrapping paper I had hidden in my closet.

I untied the ribbon, and opened the lid.

I do not notice the 100-dollar bills stacked neatly inside the dark oak box, the money that you had worked so hard to earn, as I picked up the picture placed neatly on top.

It was a picture of you and me, holding the participation ribbons we had received from that relay race back in elementary school. 

Trying to avoid the sight of your innocent face, I turned the photo over.

But there too, you had left a message for me. 

There will never be an award that makes me smile as much as this one did, You had written.

You had said that the box would make me happy 

How wrong you were 

There was nothing that could make me cry harder.
